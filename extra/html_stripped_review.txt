It is at that moment when Theodore Fitch (Justice Smith), a stranger who happens to be jogging along that same overpass, encourages her to step back.As much as Violet tries to push him away at the beginning of their relationship, Theodore’s determination to get her to see all the positive things about life — including lakes and the healing power of love — reinvigorates her. But as that happens, his own trauma and mental illness bubble to the service. Smith and Fanning bring thoughtful performances to this delicate tale.Even in today’s era when mental health is finally receiving the attention it deserves, black people are often left out of the conversation. So, it’s refreshing, and even cathartic, to see a young adult narrative explore how that affects black teens like Theodore who are struggling.But as progressive as “All the Bright Places” is in that respect, Theodore’s story line is not always handled with the depth it should receive. It’s an unfortunate flaw in a film that impressively balances moments of joy with equally resonating despair.All the Bright PlacesNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsElection 2020New Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshotEspañol中文网today's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilesCookingcrosswordeducationfoodhealthjobsmagazineparentingreal estatestylet magazinetravellovelistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsElection 2020New Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshotEspañol中文网today's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilesCookingcrosswordeducationfoodhealthjobsmagazineparentingreal estatestylet magazinetravellovemoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionEspañol中文网Site Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions
